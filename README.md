This is the Unoptimized Branch for Python Chat App.
These implementations are the basic versions that work to some degree and include a lot of inefficiencies.
For text, video, and voice chat, use ChatClient.py and ChatServer.py.
After installing Python 3, run the following pip commands in a terminal.
Make sure to do this before using any of the files otherwise they may not work.

pip install virtualenv
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate
pip install opencv-python
pip install tk
pip install imutils
pip install sockets
pip install threaded
pip install numpy

For windows (pyaudio errors):
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio

For linux (pyaudio errors and tk errors):
sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
